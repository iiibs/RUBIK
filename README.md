# RUBIK

 A program that is aimed to solve an arbitrary Rubik-like (twisty) puzzle starting from two text files:
 1. a textual description of the puzzle, and
 2. an also textual description of the source and target states of the puzzle.
 It will make up all the structure contents that are needed to model the puzzle.
 Then it will try to find basic solutions for the given source state and return the shortest.
 
 The project is not yet complete, it is still test phase for the basic Rubik puzzle, called Pocket Cube.

 The basic structures and a random walk in the puzzle domain already works.


 The latest achivement is that the program is able to find the shortest solutions for each element indivudally.
